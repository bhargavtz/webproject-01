                    <p class="mt-3">IELTS is an English language test that is expected of foreign students and workers
                        who wish to study or work in a country where English is the primary language of communication.
                        The United Kingdom, The United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are the most common
                        countries where IELTS is approved for university admissions.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">What is PTE?</h4>

                    <p>PTE is English speaking, learning, writing, and reading Course. PTE is also known as The Pearson
                        Test of English. It is a computerized Exam Easy learning and faster result giving PTE test
                        allowed by various Government, universities, and Education Center.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Best IELTS and PTE coaching center in Surat (Ocean Dolphin consultancy&#39;s
                        Guidance for changes in IELTS)</h4>

                    <p>The student&#39;s English language skills in Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking will be
                        assessed using the IELTS Indicator. Students may take the test from the comfort of their own
                        homes through the internet. We Ocean Dolphin consultancy provides online education with full
                        Guidance and personal attention.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Why is the IELTS Exam required?</h4>

                    <p>Every year most students apply for a Student visa, Students from different categories and
                        different fields have many queries and questions. Ocean Dolphin consultancy always is for their
                        students to give them a better chance to catch their dream. The IELTS 2021 exam is required for
                        migration and academic purposes in English- speaking. The short answer is that international
                        universities and visa granting authorities want to make sure you won&#39;t have any contact
                        problems when you&#39;re there. Since your overall IELTS scores are so significant, you must
                        demonstrate a clear understanding and command of the English language. Another common
                        misunderstanding among students is whether or not IELTS is a required exam. IELTS is not needed
                        for all university admissions. Many universities do not even need IELTS scores to be considered
                        for admission. But keep in mind that if you don&#39;t take IELTS, your chances of getting a
                        student visa may be harmed because visa officers may be skeptical of your English proficiency if
                        you don&#39;t have IELTS scores. As a result, it is better to take IELTS and strive for a score
                        of at least 6 bands overall. You should take the IELTS test once a week with the British Council
                        or IDP (four times a month). The British Council and IDP have a global test schedule of 48 days
                        per year.</p>

                    <p>If you need to change your test day, you must request a test day switch at least five weeks
                        before your scheduled test day and pay the cancellation/postponement fee. Additionally, the new
                        test date must fall within three months of the initial test date. For the move of a test date,
                        candidates must pay an administrative fee of INR 3,300, inclusive of all taxes.</p>

                    <p>We Ocean Dolphin consultancy had a great experience of last few years. The most significant
                        disadvantages of studying abroad are having to pay tuition and external charges in a foreign
                        currency while still dealing with high living costs. Because of these factors, many students are
                        unable to travel abroad. Students can now realize their dreams thanks to the availability of
                        numerous IELTS Scholarships and education loans. Scholarships, as well as other fellowships and

                    <h5 class="mt-4">IELTS Scores</h5>

                    <p>IELTS test results are usually available within a week (online) or 13 calendar days (offline)

                    <h5 class="mt-4">Cut-off Scores for IELTS</h5>

                    <p>IELTS is a test that evaluates students&rsquo; English language skills at all stages. As a
                        result, students will never fail the exam. On a scale of 1 to 9, students receive an IELTS score
                        for each of the four skills, as well as an overall band score. Candidates should be aware that
                        the IELTS cut-off score varies depending on which colleges and programs they are interested in,
                        and that not all universities and programs require candidates to pass the IELTS test. If you
                        want to apply to universities, get a job, or immigrate to an English-speaking country, your
                        overall IELTS band score is crucial.</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">Colleges that accept IELTS</h5>

                    <p>Taking the IELTS test opens up a world of possibilities. Technical associations, schools,
                        colleges, and universities are among them. This test will specifically track the
                        aspirant&rsquo;s use of the English language at work and in school, as well as how the aspirant
                        will handle contact while abroad. More than 3 million IELTS exams are taken each year, making it
                        the most common English language examination.</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">IELTS Scores Accepted by Countries</h5>

                    <p>The IELTS exam is recognized in over 140 countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, New
                        Zealand, the United States, and Canada. You can take IELTS for research, job, or Education
                        purposes, and if you get a good score, you can apply to your preferred country. Before taking
                        the IELTS test, it&rsquo;s a good idea to double-check the university/country criteria.Those

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Tips for IELTS 2021 Preparation</h4>

                    <p>There are two methods for preparing for the IELTS exam: self-study and taking coaching courses.
                        It is up to you to decide which choice is best for you based on your language skills and comfort
                        level. You do not need to attend coaching classes if you are already fluent in English; you can
                        train for the exam on your own. In addition, if saving money is a priority, self-study is a
                        better choice. However, keep in mind that in order to prepare independently, you&rsquo;ll need
                        the most up-to-date training tips for each portion of the IELTS exam. Coaching courses, on the
                        other hand, are a reasonable choice if you don&rsquo;t have enough time and need competent
                        supervision for exam training. Your time will be better spent and attending classes on a daily
                        basis will become part of your routine.</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">Exam day advice for IELTS</h5>

                    <p>Each exam has its own preparation method, which affects how the exam day is handled. Planning
                        your test day and strategizing ways to crack the question paper is just as important as training
                        for the exam. As a result, being exam-day ready is just as critical as being familiar with the
                        syllabus. Before you enter the examination hall, review the IELTS exam day tips.</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">Question/Sample Paper for IELTS</h5>

                    <p>You&rsquo;ll need to know how much you&rsquo;ve progressed when studying for the test. Knowing
                        where you stand will assist you in moving forward with your planning. As a result, it is
                        recommended that you continue to take IELTS practice tests on a regular basis. It will also
                        assist you in preparing yourself to face and handle the question paper effectively on exam day,
                        without panicking.</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-4">India&rsquo;s IELTS Test Centers</h5>

                    <p>IELTS exam centers can be found all over India. You can take the exam in 78 locations around
                        India. You should choose your place carefully, keeping in mind that you should not have to drive
                        too far on the day of the test. Choose a location that requires little travel time so that you
                        can focus on the test. With so many places, finding a test center near your home should be easy.
                        Keep in mind that you must schedule the test center ahead of time according to your schedule.

                        anyone applying to Canada for a work visa, permanent residency, or professional intent.</p>

                            IDP, there is no distinction between the two departments. As a result, you can take the
                            IELTS exam administered by&nbsp;either of the organizations.</li>
